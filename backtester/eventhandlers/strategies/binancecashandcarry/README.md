## Binance Cash and carry strategy overview

## Important
This strategy was initially designed for the exchange FTX. It is currently being ported to Binance. It does not work at present.

### Description
Cash and carry is a strategy which takes advantage of the difference in pricing between a long-dated futures contract and a SPOT asset.
By default, this cash and carry strategy will, upon the first data event, purchase BTC-USD SPOT asset from Binance exchange and then, once filled, raise a SHORT for BTC-20210924 FUTURES contract.
On the last event, the strategy will close the SHORT position by raising a LONG of the same contract amount, thereby netting the difference in prices

### Requirements
- At this time of writing, this strategy is only compatible with Binance
- This strategy *requires* `Simultaneous Signal Processing` aka [use-simultaneous-signal-processing](/backtester/config/README.md).
- This strategy *requires* `Exchange Level Funding` aka [use-exchange-level-funding](/backtester/config/README.md).

### Creating a strategy config
- The long-dated futures contract will need to be part of the `currency-settings` of the contract
- Funding for purchasing SPOT assets will need to be part of `funding-settings`
- See the [example config](./config/strategyexamples/binance-cash-carry.strat)

### Customisation
This strategy does support strategy customisation in the following ways:

| Field | Description |  Example |
| --- | ------- | --- |
| openShortDistancePercentage | If there is no short position open, and the difference between FUTURES and SPOT pricing goes above this this percentage threshold, raise a SHORT order of the FUTURES contract | 10 |
| closeShortDistancePercentage | If there is an open SHORT position on a FUTURES contract, and the difference in FUTURES and SPOT pricing goes below this percentage threshold, close the SHORT position | 1 |
