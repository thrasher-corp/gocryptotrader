## Exchange package overview

The exchange eventhandler is responsible for calling the `engine` package's `ordermanager` to place either a fake, or real order on the exchange via API.

The following steps are taken for the `ExecuteOrder` function:

- Calculate slippage. If the order is a sell order, it will reduce the price by a random percentage between the two values. If it is a buy order, it will raise the price by a random percentage between the two values
  - If `RealOrders` is set to `false`:
    - It will estimate the slippage based on what is in the config file under `min-slippage-percent` and `max-slippage-percent`.
    - It will be sized within the constraints of the current candles OHLCV values
    - It will generate the exchange fee based on what is stored in the config for the exchange asset currency pair
  - If `RealOrders` is set to `true`, it will use the latest orderbook data to calculate slippage by simulating the order
 - Place the order with the engine order manager
  - If `RealOrders` is set to `false` it will submit the order with no calls to the exchange's API, use no API credentials and it will always pass
  - If `RealOrders` is set to `true` it will submit the order via the exchange's API and if successful, will be stored in the order manager
 - If an order is successfully placed, a snapshot of all existing orders in the run will be captured and store for statistical purposes
