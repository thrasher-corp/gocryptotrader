## Strategy Config overview

### What does the config package do?
The config package contains a set of structs which allow for the customisation of the GoCryptoTrader Backtester when running.
The GoCryptoTrader Backtester runs from reading config files (`.strat` files by default under `/examples`).


### What does Simultaneous Processing mean?
GoCryptoTrader Backtester config files may contain multiple `ExchangeSettings` which defined exchange, asset and currency pairs to iterate through a period of time.

If there are multiple entries to `ExchangeSettings` and SimultaneousProcessing is disabled, then each individual exchange, asset and currency pair candle event is evaluated individually and does not know about other exchange, asset and currency pair data events. It is a way to test a singular strategy against multiple assets simultaneously. But it isn't defined as Simultaneous Processing
Simultaneous Signal Processing is a setting which allows multiple `ExchangeSettings` data events for a candle event to be considered simultaneously. This means that you can check if the price of BTC-USDT is 5% greater on Binance than it is on Kraken and choose to make signal a BUY event for Kraken and not Binance.

It allows for complex strategical decisions to be made when you consider the scope of the entire market at a given time, rather than in a vacuum when SimultaneousSignalProcessing is disabled.

### How do I customise the GoCryptoTrader Backtester?

| use-simultaneous-signal-processing | This denotes whether multiple currencies are processed simultaneously with the strategy function `OnSimultaneousSignals`. Eg If you have multiple CurrencySettings and only wish to purchase BTC-USDT when XRP-DOGE is 1337, this setting is useful as you can analyse both signal events to output a purchase call for BTC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `true`                                                                    |
| disable-usd-tracking               | If `false`, will track all currencies used in your strategy against USD equivalent candles. For example, if you are running a strategy for BTC/XRP, then the GoCryptoTrader Backtester will also retrieve candles data for BTC/USD and XRP/USD to then track strategy performance against a single currency. This also tracks against USDT and other USD tracked stablecoins, so one exchange supporting USDT and another BUSD will still allow unified strategy performance analysis. If disabled, will not track against USD, this can be especially helpful when running strategies under live, database and CSV based data | `false`                                                                   |
| custom-settings                    | This is a map where you can enter custom settings for a strategy.
