## Plugins package overview

Golang Plugins are supported by the GoCryptoTrader Backtester. At present, only custom strategies are supported.

Please read the Golang documentation on [plugins](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/) for more information.

## Building Golang Plugins

### Windows
Plugin support is not yet available for Windows. However, you can still build via WSL. See below for instructions on a basic setup for WSL. Once completed, follow the instructions for Linux.
#### WSL Setup
The following is a basic setup for WSL: [here](https://pureinfotech.com/install-wsl-windows-11/)

### Linux, macOS & WSL
A plugin is a Go main package with exported functions and variables that has been built with:

```bash
go build -buildmode=plugin
```

This outputs a file named `plugins.so` which can be loaded by the backtester. At present, only custom strategies can be loaded. See [here](/strategies/example/README.md) for more information on building custom strategies via plugins.

You must ensure that the plugin is built with the same version of code as the GoCryptoTrader Backtester. Otherwise the plugin will refuse to load.



#### Installing Golang in WSL
See the following for instructions on installing Golang in WSL: [here](https://ao.ms/how-to-install-golang-on-wsl-wsl2/)
