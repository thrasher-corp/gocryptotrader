# GoCryptoTrader Backtester
An event-driven backtesting tool to test and iterate trading strategies using historical or custom data.

## Features
- Works with all GoCryptoTrader exchanges that support trade/candle retrieval
- API data retrieval
- CSV data import
- Database data import
- Proof of concept live data running
- Can run strategies against multiple cryptocurrencies
- Can run strategies that can assess multiple currencies to make complex decisions
- Dollar cost strategy implementation
- RSI strategy implementation
- Strategy customisation via config `.strat` files
- Report generation
- Portfolio manager to help size orders based on config rules, risk and candle volume
- Order manager to place orders with customisable slippage estimator
- Helpful statistics to help determine whether a strategy was effective
- Compliance manager to keep snapshots of every transaction and their changes at every interval

## How does it work?
- The application will load a `.strat` config file as specified at runtime
- The `.strat` config file will contain
  - Start & end dates
  - The strategy to run
  - The candle interval
  - Where the data is to be sourced ([API](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/tree/backscratcher/backtester/data/kline/api), [CSV](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/tree/backscratcher/backtester/data/kline/csv), [database](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/tree/backscratcher/backtester/data/kline/database), [live](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/tree/backscratcher/backtester/data/kline/live))
  - Whether to use trade or candle data ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/data/kline/README.md))
  - A nickname for the strategy (to help differentiate between runs/configs using the same strategy)
  - The currency/currencies to use
  - The exchange(s) to run against
  - See [readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/config/README.md) for a breakdown of all config features
- The GoCryptoTrader Backtester will retrieve the data specified in the config ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/backtest/README.md))
- The data is converted into candles and each candle is streamed as a data event.
- The data event is analysed by the strategy which will output a purchasing signal such as `BUY`, `SELL` or `DONOTHING` ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/tree/backscratcher/backtester/eventtypes/signal))
- The purchase signal is then processed by the portfolio manager ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/eventhandlers/portfolio/README.md)) which will size the order ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/eventhandlers/portfolio/size/README.md)) and assess risk ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/eventhandlers/portfolio/risk/README.md)) before sending it to the exchange
- The exchange order event handler will size to the candle data and run a slippage estimator ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/eventhandlers/exchange/slippage/README.md) and place the order ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/tree/backscratcher/backtester/eventhandlers/exchange))
- Upon an order being placed, the order is snapshot for analysis in both the statistics package ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/eventhandlers/statistics/README.md)) and the report package ([readme](https://github.com/gloriousCode/gocryptotrader/blob/backscratcher/backtester/report/README.md))


# Cool story, how do I use it?
To run the application using the provided dollar cost average strategy, simply run `go run .` from `gocryptotrader/backtester`. An output of the results will be put in the `results` folder
