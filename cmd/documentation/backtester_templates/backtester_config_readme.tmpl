## {{.CapitalName}} package overview

### What does the config package do?
The config package contains a set of structs which allow for the customisation of the GoCryptoTrader Backtester when running.
The GoCryptoTrader Backtester runs from reading config files (`.strat` files by default under `/examples`).

### How do I customise the GoCryptoTrader Backtester?
See below for a set of tables and fields, expected values and what they can do

#### Config
| Key | Description |
| --- | ------|
| Nickname | A nickname for the specific config. When running multiple variants of the same strategy, use the nickname to help differentiate between runs |
| CurrencySettings | Currency settings is an array of settings for each individual currency you wish to run the strategy against. |
| StrategySettings | Select which strategy to run, what custom settings to load and whether the strategy can assess multiple currencies at once to make more in-depth decisions |
| PortfolioSettings | Contains a list of global rules for the portfolio manager. CurrencySettings contain their own rules on things like how big a position is allowable, the portfolio manager rules are the same, but override any individual currency's settings |
| StatisticSettings | Contains settings that impact statistics calculation. Such as the risk-free rate for the sharpe ratio |

#### Currency Settings
| Key | Description |
| --- | -------|
| ExchangeName | The exchange to load. See [here](https://github.com/thrasher-corp/gocryptotrader/blob/master/README.md) for a list of supported exchanges |
| Asset | The asset type. Typically, this will be `spot`, however, see [this package](https://github.com/thrasher-corp/gocryptotrader/blob/master/exchanges/asset/asset.go) for the various asset types GoCryptoTrader supports|
| Base | The base of a currency, eg BTC |
| Quote | The quote of a currency, eg USDT |
| InitialFunds | The funds that the GoCryptoTraderBacktester has for the specific currency, eg 10000 |
| Leverage | This struct defines the leverage rules that this specific currency setting must abide by |
| BuySide | This struct defines the buying side rules this specific currency setting must abide by such as maximum purchase amount |
| SellSide | This struct defines the selling side rules this specific currency setting must abide by such as maximum selling amount |
| MinimumSlippagePercent | Is the lower bounds in a random number generated that make purchases more expensive, or sell events less valuable. If this value is 90, then the most a price can be affected is 10% |
| MaximumSlippagePercent | Is the upper bounds in a random number generated that make purchases more expensive, or sell events less valuable. If this value is 99, then the least a price can be affected is 1%. Set both upper and lower to 100 to have no randomness applied to purchase events |
| MakerFee | The fee to use when sizing and purchasing currency |
| TakerFee | Unused fee for when an order is placed in the orderbook, rather than taken from the orderbook |
| MaximumHoldingsRatio | When multiple currency settings are used, you may set a maximum holdings ratio to prevent having too large a stake in a single currency |

#### Strategy Settings
| Key | Description |
| --- | -------|
| Name | The strategy to use. |
| IsMultiCurrency | This denotes whether multiple currencies are considered simultaneously with the strategy function `OnSignals`. Eg If you have multiple CurrencySettings and only wish to purchase BTC-USDT when XRP-DOGE is 1337, this setting is useful as you can analyse both signal events to output a purchase call for BTC. |
| CustomSettings | This is a map where you can enter custom settings for a strategy. The RSI strategy allows for customisation of the upper, lower and length variables to allow you to change them from 70, 30 and 14 respectively to 69, 36, 12 |
