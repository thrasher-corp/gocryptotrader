# The Angular version of the front-end is being replaced by a React implementation on this branch: https://github.com/thrasher-corp/gocryptotrader/tree/react-web/web
### There will be no further development on the Angular front end and all development should be directed to the new branch until it is merged.

## Install dependencies with npm

``` bash
npm install
```

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

``` bash
npm run start:web
```

Currently runs with:

- Angular v7

## To build for production

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !
