/* For efficiency, a JSON to Golang converter can be used: https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/
However, great care must be taken as to the values which are autogenerated. The JSON converter tool will default to whatever type it detects, 
but ultimately conversions to a more useful variable type would be better. For example, price and quantity on some exchange API's provide these as strings. Internally, 
it would be better if they're converted to the more useful float64 var type.
