## Current Features for Sync manager
+ The currency pair syncer subsystem is used to keep all trades, tickers and orderbooks up to date for all enabled exchange asset currency pairs
+ It can sync data via a websocket connection or REST and will switch between them if there has been no updates
+ In order to modify the behaviour of the currency pair syncer subsystem, you can change runtime parameters as detailed below:

| Config | Description | Example |
| ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| syncmanager | Determines whether the subsystem is enabled | `true` |
| tickersync |  Enables ticker syncing for all enabled exchanges |   `true`|
| orderbooksync | Enables orderbook syncing for all enabled exchanges |  `true` |
| tradesync | Enables trade syncing for all enabled exchanges |  `true` |
| syncworkers | The amount of workers (goroutines) to use for syncing exchange data | `15` |
| synccontinuously | Whether to sync exchange data continuously (ticker, orderbook and trades) | `true` |
| synctimeout | The amount of time in golang `time.Duration` format before the syncer will switch from one protocol to the other (e.g. from REST to websocket) | `15000000000` |
