## Current Features for order

+ This package services the exchanges package with order handling.
	- Creation of order
	- Deletion of order
	- Order tracking

+ For futures orders, this package also contains a futures position controller. It is responsible for tracking all futures orders that GoCryptoTrader processes. It keeps a running history of realised and unreaslied PNL to allow a trader to track their profits. Positions are closed once the exposure reaches zero, then upon a new futures order being processed, a new position is created. To view futures positions, see the GRPC command `getfuturesposition`
